# Ryan Hansen
title: Welcome to Ryanville
description: Amazement
Welcome to **Ryanville**, home of my thoughts, dreams, and humble autobiography.
_Note_, this is a perpetual work in progress site. I wouldn't call it a blog, but it is the central hub of my mental castle

## Things I want to do
1. Make this site cool (Learn+setup markdown + Jekyll)
2. Get a linux dual boot for this computer (so I can do stuff easier)
3. Get super good at an instrument or multiple (Priority: Violin, Guitar, Piano)
4. Fitness: Run a half-marathon, do some trail runs, ski more (downhill and touring), ice climb, rock climb more, surf, hockey
5. Come up with the cool mental castle thing
6. Travel: Sweden, Iceland, Bay area, Somewhere tropical, Nepal (because I can only imagine what a huge mountain looks like)
7. Language: Swedish (Something scandanavian I am thinking, to honor my ancestory. Also I think it sounds cool.
8. Research: Find some Modeling, pattern finding, or other theory problem that is super interesting and meaningful
9. I Really want to travel around the world and find people with interesting jobs and interview them to see what they like and dislike about their career. I hope to find something perfect for me that way, and maybe make indecision obsolete.
10. Get a wild job
11. Resin Mobius Strip in a cube (Paper covered in resin)
12. buy a ton of magnets - make a float key holder - rocks in it and everything.
13. Water features
14. Plants (Cactus)

## Research
My hope is to use abstract math like category theory and topology, apply it to some phenomena, and notice that certain abstract properties happen to be very meaningful. 
I like representation problems, where representing problems in different models gains unique and advantageous benefits. I also like efficiency/optimization problems. 
I like abstracting ideas and making things general.
I like to model things and draw conclusions from those models (if the model was in _THIS_ scenario, interesting behavior happens that we may seek or avoid)
I like exploratory stuff and general advancement of my knowledge (My hope is that building up my toolbox will help me be able to solve more problems, or even be inspired by various ideas and apply them elsewhere)
- 3d Screen (graphics + physics optics comes into play)

I am nearing my first publication regarding the advantages of assessing model fitness using _Sheaves_. Link to that coming soon

## Stuff I like to do
Have fun with friends
Listen to good music, and also play music
Run + gym
Watch TV (Comedy, Action as long as they get a good lead like the first Thor movie, Lord of the Rings is still my all time favorite)
Video Games (Civilization 5 is the irrefutable most beautiful masterpiece of game technology to ever grace this world. Also I like dark souls and most RPGs i've tried.)
Explore + try new things

## Sense of Humor
Witty, Absurdist, and Relatable (In most scenarios, the amount I laugh is directly proportional to how weird and creative something is)

## Music I like
Working top 10: [Top 10](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-6hxOwG1xJlavPiv3NxLY5_K1CDRX2aA)
I mostly like chill music, reggae, funk, groovy, indie, some pop, and some rock. Not a huge metal guy

## Philosophizing and Random other stuff
A google doc where I have this stuff [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTsDKY4zTMTHi-7Ku6KE5wsMBQJ28zJXZJ4oOvG_5ZLxO3wl40lb3gkVgZdfwoCDV05iexHjVraGmn2/pub)
- The key is to trust myself (make commitments with myself and keep them)
## Youtube Channel
I do not recommend the sane person to look here
